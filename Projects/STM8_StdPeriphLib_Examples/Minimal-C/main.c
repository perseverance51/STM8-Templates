/**********************
  simple C-project without Arduino-like initialization and with calls to the 
  STM8 Standard Peripheral Library (SPL)
  (SDCC patch available from https://github.com/gicking/STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch)
  No further assumption is made, no interrupts are used.
  Can be used as starting point for SPL projects with extreme memory limitations.
  Note that device headers from STM8_templates and SPL are incompatible ->
  need to create separate SPL.c file in project folder and use interface
  functions (here simply 'SPL_init()' and 'SPL_setPin()').
  Advantage is transparent mixing of STM8_templates (simple) with STM8
  SPL library (powerful) and examples by STM.
  Functionality:
  - init FCPU to 16MHz
  - configure pin as output
  - toggle pin every 500ms w/o timer -> blocking
