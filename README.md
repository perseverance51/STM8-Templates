STM8 Templates with Arduino look&feel 
=================
本项目来自于：https://github.com/gicking/STM8_templates
原作者已经停止维护。在此基础上对STVP开发平台所有项目进行了编译测试,保证都能通过。但是不保证所有程序，烧录到目标芯片上能否都能达到预期效果。

Due to lack of time and shifted emphasis this repository is no longer maintained. Sorry for any inconvenience and thanks a lot for your understanding! 

------------------

This repository provides "Arduino-like" C-libraries & -templates for the low-cost [STM8A and STM8S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STM8) 8-bit microcontrollers by [STMicro](http://st.com).

Where sensible, compatibility with Arduino has been kept. However, due to focus on easy porting to new STM8 boards and some new features, 100% Arduino-compatibility was not always achievable. If you seek this, please check out the [_sduino_ project](https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino). 

- details on installation and an API description can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/gicking/STM8_templates/wiki)
- a more detailed description of the implementation can be generated by running [_doxygen_](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) with file 'Doxyfile' in folder 'Docu'
- for bugs reports, feature requests, please drop me a note or use the [issues page](https://github.com/gicking/STM8_templates/issues)
- for legal stuff see [LICENSE](LICENSE)
- and, last but not least, volunteers are highly welcome...

Have fun!
Georg Icking-Konert
